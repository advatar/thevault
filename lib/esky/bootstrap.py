  esky.bootstrap:  minimal bootstrapping code for esky

This module provides the minimal code necessary to bootstrap a frozen
application packaged using esky.  It checks the base runtime directory to
find the most appropriate version of the app and then execvs to the frozen
executable.

This module must use no modules other than builtins, since the stdlib is
not available in the bootstrapping environment.  It must also be capable
of bootstrapping into apps made with older versions of esky, since a partial
update could result in the boostrapper from a new version being forced
to load an old version.

The code from this module is always executed in the bootstrapping environment
before any custom bootstrapping code.  It provides the following functions for
use during the bootstrap process:

  Chainloading:         execv, chainload
  Filesystem:           listdir, exists, basename, dirname, pathjoin
  Version handling:     split_app_version, join_app_version, parse_version,
                        get_all_versions, get_best_version, is_version_dir,
                        is_installed_version_dir, is_uninstalled_version_dir,
                        lock_version_dir, unlock_version_dir
